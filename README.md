Dijkstra's Algorithm:
====================
Overview:
----------

Dijkstra's algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights and is commonly used in navigation systems, network routing protocols, and more.
Key Concepts:

    Graph: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
    Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has a numerical value associated with it, known as a weight.
    Shortest Path: The path between two nodes with the minimum total weight.
    Priority Queue: A data structure used in Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently select the next node to visit.

Steps:

    Initialize the distance to all nodes as infinity, except the start node which is set to 0.
    Create a priority queue to store nodes based on their tentative distances.
    While the priority queue is not empty:
        Extract the node with the smallest tentative distance from the priority queue.
        For each neighboring node:
            Calculate the tentative distance from the start node through the current node.
            If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance.
    Continue until all nodes have been visited or the end node is reached.

Time and Space Complexity:
=========================

    Time Complexity: O((V + E) * log(V)), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    Space Complexity: O(V) for storing the priority queue.

This script calculates the shortest path between two locations on a map represented by a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Functions:
1. dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, end)
   Calculates the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
   Parameters:
     - graph: A graph object representing the map with nodes and weighted edges.
     - start: The starting node from where the shortest path should begin.
     - end: The destination node where the shortest path should end.
   Returns:
     - path: A list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
     - path_length: The length or distance of the shortest path in kilometers.

2. visualize_shortest_path(graph, path)
   Visualizes the shortest path on the graph.
   Parameters:
     - graph: A graph object representing the map with nodes and weighted edges.
     - path: A list of nodes representing the shortest path to visualize.

Usage:
- Create a graph object using NetworkX, representing the map with nodes and weighted edges.
- Call the dijkstra_shortest_path function with the graph and start and end nodes to find the shortest path.
- Call the visualize_shortest_path function to visualize the shortest path on the graph.

Example:
- In the given example, a sample graph is created with edge weights in kilometers. The shortest path from node 'A' to node 'E' is calculated and visualized on the graph.
