     <h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm Complexity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Time Complexity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm depends on the data structure used to implement the priority queue.</li>
                <li>With a binary heap priority queue, the time complexity is typically O((V + E) * log(V)), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.</li>
                <li>The O(V + E) term accounts for the time taken to explore each vertex and edge in the graph.</li>
                <li>The log(V) term comes from the operations involving the priority queue, such as insertion, deletion, and updating priorities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Space Complexity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The space complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm primarily depends on the data structures used.</li>
                <li>With a priority queue implementation, the space complexity is typically O(V) for storing the priority queue.</li>
                <li>Additional space may be required for storing the graph itself, such as adjacency lists or matrices, but this is typically dwarfed by the space required for the priority queue.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, Dijkstra's algorithm is an efficient way to find the shortest paths in a graph, especially for graphs with non-negative edge weights. Its time complexity is typically O((V + E) * log(V)), and its space complexity is O(V) with a binary heap priority queue implementation.</p>
